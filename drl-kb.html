<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>About Role banding and its impact<br />1. Why is the role band change exercise being conducted?<br />In the previous year, we embarked on an organization transformation journey with several new<br />initiatives, renewed efforts and a greater drive towards growth and execution excellence.<br />The re-banding project was first undertaken in 2011, with similar intentions, however, a lot has<br />evolved since then and hence we decided to redesign the organization with focus on strengthen the<br />principles of meritocracy.<br />2. What does this initiative aspire to achieve?<br /> Culture where you will be identified by the role you play and not by the designation you<br />hold. We will be defined by the work we do<br /> Employees aspire for greater roles, responsibilities and experiences<br /> &ldquo;Professional growth&rsquo; will be viewed more holistically beyond mere vertical moves<br /> Role Bands will be broader to encourage greater lateral movements and focus on job<br />content<br /> A Band structure that allows employees to grow in the same role by deep skilling and multi-<br />skilling<br /> Greater external and internal role parity, ensuring greater recognition of relative<br />contribution<br /> Attract and retain talent from the talent markets that we operate in<br />3. Why are we removing designations?<br />Designations will be replaced with role titles internally to signify what a role holder does instead of<br />becoming a label for role bands. In all internal working, communication, we will stop using<br />hierarchical designations and keep only role titles&nbsp;(for example &ndash; someone who is a &lsquo;Senior Director<br />and Head of a unit&rsquo; in the old system will be now be &lsquo;Head of the unit&rsquo;; someone who is a &lsquo;Manager<br />and Team Lead&rsquo; in the old system will be a &lsquo;Team Lead.<br />For external facing roles e.g. those who deal with customers, regulators, government bodies, we will<br />have a pre-agreed range of external designations that can be used. These will be created as relevant<br />to the specific countries and agreed upon by the respective MC.<br />4. How did we arrive at the new bands? OR What was the rationale for reducing role bands?<br />New bands have been arrived through a careful assessment of all the roles. These roles have been<br />clustered basis similarities in complexity, size and responsibility and with the help of an external<br />consultant reputed for organization design this new structure has been tailor made for DRL keeping<br />in mind the future organization aspiration.<br />5. Will the new bands lead to more layoffs? Is there another wave coming?</p>
<p>It is not about cost cutting, demotions, salary reduction or manpower reduction. This is an initiative<br />aimed at giving Dr Reddy&rsquo;s a forward-looking culture that we need to succeed in the new<br />environment.<br />6. I am right now in R1A, I should have been in R1B, with the re banding project will I be placed<br />band equivalent to R1B or R1A.( employees perspective) OR<br />I was hired at R1B however the role that I am doing is that of a R2A currently. Post re-banding<br />will my role be pegged equivalent to an R2.( other people doing the same role are given R2A<br />role band)<br />All employees shall be fitted to a new role band. Positioning within a role band is based on the role.<br />It is not a factor of where your current role band is positioned. Similar roles will be pegged in the<br />same band. What earlier what would have been a band movement from X to Y may not be so in the<br />new structure as the number of layers have been reduced. These will be agreed as relevant to the<br />specific country with BU Head.<br />7. With no designations, how will I compare myself relative to external market?<br />Designations differ across organizations in the market and are not ideal for comparisons. For<br />example when we hire candidates externally we focus on the role the candidate played in the<br />previous organization, nature of experience and contribution made to these roles. Designation of<br />&ldquo;director&rdquo; in one organization may be equivalent to &ldquo;Board of Directors&rdquo; in another organization.<br />8. I used to use the designation of Vice President for interactions with external forums. In the<br />absence of designations how will I be able to influence the authorities?<br />For roles which require designations for external interactions with customers, government and<br />regulatory bodies. For such roles, market facing designations will be available<br />9. We still have bands so how come we are saying we are moving to a role based organization?<br />Today, role bands are used to determine most aspects of rewards, benefits, entitlements, approvals<br />and employee representation in the Company. Going forward we would like to focus on roles being<br />performed instead of the role bands. Bands provide a framework within which roles will be<br />positioned.<br />Promotion / Progression/ Growth<br />10. When is promotion going to happen? &nbsp;Will this happen simultaneously with Re-Banding<br />results?<br />Promotions in the new framework will be based upon taking up a larger role that is at a higher band.<br />As we are now resetting the band structure - employees will be placed in the band commensurate of<br />the role they are performing .Promotions therefore going forward will not follow a scheduled cycle<br />and will take place as a consequence of an employee qualifying and starting to perform a higher<br />role.<br />11. Promotions were supposed to be in January, now that the cycle did not happen, will the<br />promotions now be effective from 1st of Jan? We are already three months past Jan. I have<br />lost out on compensation<br />No, promotions will not be effective from 1 st of Jan (refer response above)</p>
<p>12. Employees (R3 and below) who would have been promoted in January&rsquo;19 post re-banding may<br />fall in the band where promotion/progression may not be available to him/her immediately.<br />How are we going to take care of such employees?<br />It is important to understand that we are moving away from promotion entitlement based on<br />tenure. For employees who are in first two bands, progression opportunities are available on skill &amp;amp;<br />knowledge enhancement<br />Performance of employees will continue to be rewarded through compensation.<br />You will now have all the information required to move their career forward which includes vertical<br />and horizontal growth. You are encouraged to look at growth in terms of acquiring more skills,<br />building depth and gaining more experiences for professional growth<br />13. What will be my growth prospects in case there are no next level roles? OR<br />In my role I don&rsquo;t see a space to move further upward in terms of promotion as there is no<br />vacancy. How do I grow in my career here then?<br />Growth has to be viewed beyond tenured promotions and vertical growth. It involves ensuring<br />professional development by gathering the necessary skills and experiences in order to take up next<br />level roles. Growth will be available in the form of multi-skilling, deep skilling and lateral movements.<br />14. I was nominated in October for promotion and have completed 2 years tenure but I will now<br />not be promoted.<br />We have ensured that the roles have been pegged at the right band. Those roles which have been<br />evaluated to be significantly higher will receive an associated salary increase effective from April<br />2019.<br />15. Was it worth stopping promotions for one year?<br />As part of organization transformation, in the last year we have taken several difficult yet necessary<br />decisions. The decision to delay promotions was important in order to set the house in order by<br />assessing the current positioning of roles internally and externally, defining clear promotion criteria<br />and bringing in objectivity &amp;amp; transparency in assessments<br />Compensation<br />16. In the new band structure if I am pegged at a lower band will my compensation reduce?<br />There will be no reduction in salary.<br />17. I think this move will mean a loss in benefits and variable pay for me.<br />Total compensation will remain protected. Benefits may undergo changes in specific cases.<br />18. Why are there so many sub bands at junior level?<br />We have benchmarked with similar organizations and the number of sub bands are in line with<br />external benchmarks. This will encourage multi-skilling, deep skilling and tenure in the same role<br />while providing visible growth.<br />19. Who decided and approved my role band fitting?<br />The role band positioning has been arrived at based on relative role stacking across the organization,<br />these have been validated by the respective MC and reviewed by the HR / LC.</p>
<p>20. What are checks and balances used? OR Did HR do this exercise without understanding my<br />role? Were there any biases?<br /> Internal &amp;amp; external parity basis data<br /> Validation of each role by globally renowned external vendor specializing in organization<br />design. We have engaged the same vendor who helped us with this in 2011 to ensure<br />continuity.<br /> Validation across business units to ensure role parity<br /> Validation by MC<br /> Roles were studied in details and documented in role clarity documents which were signed<br />off by the respective managers<br />21. Why are we confusing using terms promotions and progression?<br />Promotions and progressions are globally accepted terms signifying growth and organizational<br />relative movement of individuals. Simply put progressions means movement within a band (relevant<br />to the first two bands) and dependent on demonstration of higher skills, knowledge/experience, or<br />increase in role scope<br />Movement from one band to the next will be called &lsquo;Promotion&rsquo;.Promotions in the new framework<br />will essentially be taking up a larger role that is at a higher band. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />22. I believe my social standing has gone down with loss of designation<br />Who you are is what you do is the new philosophy. It is meant to remove social hierarchy and<br />promote team work and collaboration</p>
